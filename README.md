mqelvui using Lua &amp; ImGui

Create a better EverQuest UI with mElvUI. EverQuest's default UI, let's be honest, is crap. The UI elements eat up too many resources and is clunky to use in general. mElvUI will eliminate the hassle of many bad elements in the EQ UI. The initial goal is to serve as a default EQ UI replacement, for those that do not wish to use any other features of MQNext and just have a modern UI. More MQNext elements will be included in the future.

HP, MP and Endurance bars are here for you to separate your H/M/E bars. Your HP bar will also include your active disc, thus eliminating the need to have your disc window open. The HP bar also shows what buffs you need and what burns you actively have, specific to your class.

The group window shows all of your group's H/M/E %s, as well as you can target each group member through the ImGui element, thus removing most of the need for the party window. Right click options to come.

The target window will show your target, PctHP as a progress bar, target name, and your aggro. Distance & TargetType, features of MQNext, are not included at the moment, but will come as an option.

The debuff window will show only the debuffs that matter, such as Funeral Dirge, TVyl's Resolve, Mana Burn, Pinpoint Defects, slow, and Coalition. There are currently no plans to pull your DoTs, as that can slow down this element of the UI significantly. As the UI grows, these changes might come.
